# Technical Documentation: Käse mit Liebe

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 App Name
The IT system is named 'Käse mit Liebe' (Cheese with love).

### 1.2 Main Purpose and Background Context
'Käse mit Liebe' is conceived as an online platform and community primarily dedicated to hobbyist cheesemakers. Its core purpose is to provide a centralized digital ecosystem for documenting cheese batches, tracking ripening processes, accessing a repository of proven recipes, purchasing cheesemaking supplies through an online store, and fostering community support and advice via a forum. The name 'Käse mit Liebe' encapsulates the passion, dedication, and affection inherent in the craft of home cheesemaking.

### 1.3 Specific Problem to Solve
The system aims to address the lack of a dedicated, comprehensive platform where hobbyist cheesemakers can systematically document their work, manage their production nuances and ripening schedules, access reliable resources, acquire necessary supplies, and connect with a like-minded community.

### 1.4 Target Users
*   **Who:** All internet users possessing basic computer literacy. The primary user base is hobbyist cheesemakers. Professionals in specific domains (e.g., cheesemaking) are recognized as experts within the community.
*   **How Many:** No specific initial target for total users. Success will be measured by achieving 50-100 active users who create cheese batches and share their experiences.
*   **Characteristics:** Users must have basic computer literacy. They are individuals with an interest in or actively practicing hobbyist cheesemaking.

## 2. Objectives

### 2.1 Main Goals and Success Criteria (Measurable KPIs)
The success of 'Käse mit Liebe' will be quantitatively measured by the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
*   Number of registered users.
*   User activity on the site (e.g., forum participation, batch entries).
*   Sales volumes generated by the online store.

### 2.2 Expected Outcomes
The ideal expected outcomes for the system include:
*   Achieving a user base of 50-100 active users who consistently create batches of cheese and share their experiences on the platform.
*   Generating an income from online store sales of at least approximately five thousand euros (€5,000) per month.

### 2.3 Timeline Estimate and Budget Considerations
*   **Timeline Estimate:** The project is currently in the development phase, with the main functions targeted for completion by February.
*   **Budget Considerations:** No specific budget considerations provided beyond the income generation target.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Must-Have and Nice-to-Have Features

#### 3.1.1 Mandatory Functions (Must-Have)
*   **Cheesemaker's Diary:** A system allowing users to meticulously document their work, including production nuances for specific cheese batches, and accurately track the ripening of cheeses with varying durations (e.g., one month, three months, two years).

#### 3.1.2 Proposed / Planned Functions (Nice-to-Have)
*   **Online Store:** An integrated online store for convenient access to essential cheesemaking ingredients such as spices, leaven, or mold starters.
*   **Cheesemaker Map:** A geographic map feature where cheesemakers who have provided their address can be located by other users. This facilitates finding like-minded individuals or identifying local sources for homemade cheese.
*   **Recipe Repository:** A repository of proven recipes.
*   **Community Forum:** A forum for community support and advice.

### 3.2 User Requirements
*   All internet users must possess basic computer literacy to effectively use the platform.
*   Users must be able to enter and manage entries in their cheesemaker's diary.
*   Users must be able to track the ripening process of various cheese batches.
*   Users must be able to locate other cheesemakers on a map (if the feature is implemented and addresses are provided).

### 3.3 Non-Functional Requirements and Technical Constraints

#### 3.3.1 Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Multilingual Support:** The website requires multilingual support. Initially, the site will be monolingual German, with future development phases aimed at expanding to bilingual and potentially trilingual support.
*   **User Proficiency:** Users are expected to possess basic computer literacy.

#### 3.3.2 Technical Constraints
No specific technical constraints beyond those implied by the technical specifications (e.g., cloud storage, database) have been provided.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Platform and Technology Preferences
*   **Storage:** Cloud storage is required for storing photos and a database.
*   **Database:** A database is needed to contain all cheesemakers' diary information.
*   **Language Support:** The system requires multilingual support for the website.

### 4.2 Integration Needs
No specific external integration needs have been explicitly provided beyond the internal system components (online store, map, forum, diary).

### 4.3 Data Requirements
*   Cheesemakers' diary information.
*   Photos (associated with cheese batches or user profiles).
*   User addresses (optional, for the cheesemaker map feature).

### 4.4 Scalability Expectations
No specific scalability expectations have been explicitly provided.

## 5. Risks and Dependencies

No specific requirements provided for this section.

## 6. Timeline

### 6.1 Project Phases and Key Milestones
*   **Current Phase:** The project is currently in the development phase.
*   **Main Functions Completion:** The main functions are targeted for completion by February.
*   **Future Development - Language Expansion:** Future development phases include expanding the site's language support from monolingual German to bilingual, and potentially trilingual.
*   **Marketing & User Acquisition:** Upon achieving functional readiness of the core system, marketing and user acquisition activities are planned to commence.

### 6.2 Deliverables and Resource Needs
No specific deliverables or resource needs have been explicitly provided.

### 6.3 Critical Deadlines
*   Completion of main functions: By February.
